You have 3 ways to view your public bio page:

## What's Different from the Public Page?

| Preview Tab | Public Page |

| Shows all settings and metadata | Shows only public-facing content |
| Displays theme settings | Uses theme settings to style page |

| Shows creation date and stats | No admin information |
| Requires login | No login required |

2. **Use Public Page** to see exactly what visitors will see
3. **Check Status Badge** to ensure your page is "Published"
4. **Review Social Links** to make sure all URLs are correct
5. **Check Theme Colors** to ensure they match your brand

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Tab Not Showing?
